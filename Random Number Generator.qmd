## Random Number Generator

The following code generates a 13x60 matrix of random numbers. Each number is a sequence of three digits, with the first digit being 0. The code uses the `set.seed` function to ensure reproducibility. It then defines a function to generate a random sequence of three numbers beginning with 0. The function is used to fill the matrix with random sequences.The numbers are generated using the `sample` function, which selects a random number from a specified range.

```{r}
set.seed(123) # Set a seed for reproducibility

# Function to generate a string with a sequence of three numbers beginning with 0
generate_number_sequence <- function() {
  paste0('0', sprintf('%02d', sample(0:99, 1)))
}

# Initialize the matrix
random_matrix <- matrix("", nrow = 13, ncol = 60)

# Fill the matrix with the random sequences
for (row in 1:nrow(random_matrix)) {
  for (col in 1:ncol(random_matrix)) {
    random_matrix[row, col] <- generate_number_sequence()
  }
}

# Print the matrix
print(random_matrix)
```
